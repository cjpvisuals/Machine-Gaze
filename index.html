    <h1> Color Explosion </h1>

      <p>Color Explosion resembles the likes of a Snapchat filter and fills the screen with twinkling stars and explosive color. I was inspired to create this from the stars you see on Snapchat filters as well as explosive colors you see outdoors. My goal was to overwhelm the user with color and surprise them so that it would give them something fun to do. </p>
